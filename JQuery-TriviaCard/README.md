# Trivia Card
This jQuery project from Codecadmemy involved creating the code inside main.js. HTLM and CSS code was provided but files were not available. As is, if an incorrect answer is select, it is supposed to fade out and show a frowny face at the bottom. When the correct answer is selected, all the incorrect answers fade out, and a smiley face is shown. There is an option to select hint that will toggle the hint above the answers.

Ideas for changes/improvement:

* Create corresponding HTML and CSS files (in progress)
* Incorporate jQuery functionality
* Create a reset button
* More than question using an array
