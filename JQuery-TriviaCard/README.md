# Trivia Card
This JQuery project include creating the code inside the main.js file. HTLM and CSS are already completed. As is, if an incorrect answer is select, it is supposed to fade out and show a frowny face at the bottom. When the correct answer is selected, all the incorrect answers fade out, and a smiley face is shown. There is an option to select hint that will toggle the hint above the answers.

Ideas for changes/improvement:

* Create corresponding HTML and CSS files
* Create a reset button
* More than question using an array
