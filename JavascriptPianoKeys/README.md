# JavaScript - Piano Keys

This is a project from Codecademy to create a piano player with DOM elements in JavaScript.

## Notes

This is a project template with additional code written by me based on steps provided in the project. The piano keys are to change color when pressed/clicked, and the next lines of lyrics and keys to press are updated when clicking the yellow "Line" buttons.
